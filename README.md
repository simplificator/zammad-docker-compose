## Using a reverse proxy

In environments with more then one web applications it is necessary to use a reverse proxy to route connections to port 80 and 443 to the right application.
To run Zammad behind a revers proxy, we provide `docker-compose.proxy-example.yml` as a starting point.

1.  Copy `./.examples/proxy/docker-compose.proxy-example.yml` to your own configuration, e.g. `./docker-compose.prod.yml`  
    `cp ./.examples/proxy/docker-compose.proxy-example.yml ./docker-compose.prod.yml`
1.  Modify the environment variable `VIRTUAL_HOST` and the name of the external network in `./docker-compose.prod.yml` to fit your environment.
1.  Run docker-composer commands with the default and your configuration, e.g. `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d`  

See `.examples/proxy/docker-compose.yml` for an example proxy project.

Like this, you can add your `docker-compose.prod.yml` to a branch of your Git repository and stay up to date by merging changes to your branch.


## Using Letsencrypt SSL certificates

Configuration for automated configuration of letsencrypt SSL certificates is in [docker-compose.prod.yml](./docker-compose.prod.yml).

The respective initial setup has to be done by executing the interactive script [init-letsencrypt.sh](./init-letsencrypt.sh) on production. Make shure the variables at the beginning of the script are set correctly.


## Using Rancher

* RANCHER_URL=http://RANCHER_HOST:8080 rancher-compose --env-file=.env up
